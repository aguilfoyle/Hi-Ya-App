# HiYa-App

## Synopsis

The Hi-Ya app was designed and created by Alan Guilfoyle and placed 3rd during the 2015 Humana Hack-a-thon.  Each contestant had 24 hours to implement their designs based on the idea: ‘The communities that Humana serve will be healthier by 20/20’. This application takes that idea to heart and
creates a simple yet intuitive app that allows friends to communicate with each other be sending simple Hi-Ya’s. Someone would send a Hi-Ya to motivate a friend to get up and walk/exerise. A user would know to send this because during the setup the application will grab the HealthKit information stored in the iPhone and then upload
the 'steps data' in-order to display that information within a friend's Hi-Ya application. Since this was an application made within 24 hours and for a hack-a-thon a lot of the functionality is not present. This program was made in xCode 6 and has not be optimized for xCode 7. 

## Code Example

I took inspiration for my app from two applications, 'Yo' and 'Snap Chat'.

#### Here is the asking for permissions view: It uses UISwipeGestures

#### Using and experimenting with UIScrollViews: Incorporates a hamburger menu and pull down friends setting

## Motivation

The motivation for this application was to allow friends to communicate easily with each other in-order to motivate  and encourage someone to get up and be activate. Throughout the day we constantly find ourselves stuck behind a desk, computer, or cubical and sometimes we get caught up in our work and forget to stretch and get the blood flowing. I think this will help with the 20/20 goal and allow users to be more activate and get healthier one Hi-Ya at a time. 

## Installation

As mentioned earlier this project is optimized for xCode 6 and uses Swift 1.0. I have not opened this application in xCode 7 yet to allow Swift 2.0 to suggest corrections. If you download this application and run it in xCode 7 you may run into syntax complications as well as constraint issues. This application was made with a iPhone 6 plus in mind since that was my presenting iPhone size and has not been testing using other iPhone sizes.
